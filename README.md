## Hi there üëã
<h2>
Brief Bio
</h2>
<p> I am a 17 year old from the Orono area of Maine, who has been falling into computer science all of my life. At some point I realized that it might just be my calling.Since then I have been trying to make a name for myself, even though I am young and limmited. I have been asked to be on pannels, present at conferences, teach a beginners python class, and more. Soon I will be 18, as of the summer of 2025 and I have had a wonderful amount of opportunities. </p>

<p>People will ask me where I teach when I go to conferences, my answer is: in a way I don't, I am a high school student who TA's for different CS classes. I stepped up fro my school and taught a quarter of a coding class when the principle asked, becuase I knew the content and they needed help. </p>

<h2>
First ‚Äútech‚Äù I owned?
</h2>
<p> I got an tablet I got to use with my dad when I was 8. I learned how to use technology becasue my house surrounded me with it. My father is a program analyst, and my mother is a lecturer teaching computer science. My parents are the biggest stepping stone in CS for me. They gave me all the stepping stones I want, in any direction, at any height I wanted. I could have picked any path, once I took a step they encouraged more. I have ended up where I am, because of my father letting me use his tablet to play with block based coding, seeing a small animal go block to block until I won each level and having him celebrate each victory with me. </p>

<h2>
Field of Study?
</h2>
<p>I have been accepted to UMaine for Computer Science in the fall, I already take early college classes for computer science. I plan to get a masters in computer science, a certificate in education, and a bachelors of buisness with a focus in marketing.</p>
